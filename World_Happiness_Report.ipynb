        "The dataset chosen for this analysis is \"World Happiness Report\", which is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. It contains articles, and rankings of national happiness based on respondent ratings of their own lives,which the report also correlates with various life factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are some interesting alternative approaches to measure a country's happiness as it comes in many different forms and for different reasons and it can be a measure of social progress, according to the authors of the 2013 World Happiness Report. It'll be fascinating to see any correlations between hapiness and regions in the world and what factors contribute to this.\n",
